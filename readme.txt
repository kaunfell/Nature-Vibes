Nature vibes



I got an idea of a nature themed page. 
I practised to create buttons and divs in Javasript and how to add and change videos. 





Things to add:

-sound from the main page should stop when video is playing, now it stops when clicking one of the categories
-card slider/carousel. When user clicks next or previous buttons, it should add the next
div, now it only changes the actual video.
-videos should loop over, now it is only possible to go to next or previous
-more videos (now 2 on every category)
-host videos somewhere else because it takes lots of space and time to host and loop them on the page.
-animations/texture to background on every category


Here is the link to see the page:
