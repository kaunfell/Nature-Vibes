Nature vibes



I got an idea of a nature themed page. 



I practised to create buttons and divs in Javasript and how to add and change videos.




Things to add:

-sound from the main page should stop when video is playing, now it stops when clicking one of the categories
-card slider/carousel. When user clicks next or previous buttons, it should add the next
next div, now it only changes the actual video.
-slide videos like the cards, it is now only possible to go to next or previous, it does not loop over
-more videos (now 2 on every category)
-animations/texture to background on every category
